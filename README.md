# Introduction

Welcome to the **Udacity Maps Project**, introducing *The Green Edinburgh Food Map*, created by **Magdalena Stevens**

***

# About

Created using **Google Maps** and **Foursquare** API, **Knockout's** MVVM paradigm, **Bootstrap's** grid system and stylings as well as Scottish Tartan inspired customized design, this map shows some of *the best green food* (organic, local, seasonal) restaurants/cafes in **Edinburgh, Scotland**. 

The map includes a list of names of the recommended restaurants displayed with markers. These markers include the most important information about the spots, such as the address, telephone number, website, rating and price range.

User interface includes the ability to filter by price category, individual restaurant, and show or hide all markers/restaurants.
